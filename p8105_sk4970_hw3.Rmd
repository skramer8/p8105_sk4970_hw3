# Problem 1
```{r}

data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)

# each row respresent a single product from an instacart order. Variables include identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables, describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item has been ordered by this user in the past. 
```
In total, there are `r instacart %>% select(product_id) %>% distinct %>% count` products found in `r instacart %>% select(user_id, order_id) %>% distinct %>% count` orders from `r instacart %>% select(user_id) %>% distinct %>% count` distinct users.


```{r}
# Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits holding the most items ordered by far.

instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


```{r}
# The plot below shows the number of items ordered in each aisle. Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

instacart %>%
